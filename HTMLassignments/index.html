					<h5>Welcome to IMC Search</h5>
					<article>
						<p>
							That’s just what we are all about – integration of the marketing communication process, so as to be
							able to deliver to our clients – super efficient solutions - every single time.
							We are not all about advertising, public relations, event management, sales promotion, direct marketing
							– yet we are just all of that. The only difference though is the way we approach it – for us, these
							are tools tha t we use to be able to achieve the objective that YOU define to us.
							I have worked in various of these “tool segments” over the last few years, and the one thing that
							struck me everytime I approached to address a client’s requirement, I always felt there was something
							missing. As an event manager, my only solution to all my clients banes were “event – it will help
							you” – as a PR manager, public relation was manna the skies sent down.
							With over 40 cumulative years of experience, we have both the domain knowledge about the products
							and services we handle as well as in-house expertise .
